# 🤖 NewsBot 2.0

**NewsBot 2.0** is an advanced, AI-powered news analysis system that leverages modern NLP, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to automatically classify, summarize, enrich, and analyze news articles across multiple languages and topics.

## 📌 Project Overview

NewsBot 2.0 was developed as a portfolio project for the ITAI 2373 course. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Multilingual processing
- Semantic search and clustering
- Entity recognition and relationship mapping
- Intelligent summarization and sentiment tracking

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🗂️ **Multi-label News Classification**  
  Classifies articles into multiple categories with confidence scoring and explanation.

- 🧠 **Topic Modeling & Trend Analysis**  
  Automatically discovers evolving themes using LDA and NMF.

- 🎭 **Sentiment Evolution Tracking**  
  Tracks emotional tone across articles and over time.

- 🕸️ **Entity Relationship Mapping**  
  Extracts named entities and builds a knowledge graph of connections.

- 📝 **Intelligent Text Summarization**  
  Generates high-quality extractive and abstractive summaries.

- 🔍 **Semantic Search & Similarity Matching**  
  Finds related articles using sentence embeddings and clustering.

- 🌐 **Multilingual Language Detection & Translation**  
  Detects and translates non-English content with contextual awareness.

- 💡 **Content Enhancement & Fact-Checking**  
  Adds insights, flags contradictions, and cross-references information.
